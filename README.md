# ProjectEuler

This is a collection of solutions to the problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

All solutions are in Java 8 or Mathematica 11.1.

The Java solutions are general and meant to be easy to replicate in other languages.
The Java solutions contain brief solution outlines in the comments.
The Mathematica solutions will often use library functions not available in other languages and primarily focus on short and compact code.
The Mathematica solutions will not have solution outlines.
