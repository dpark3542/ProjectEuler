# ProjectEuler

This is a collection of solutions to the problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

Solutions are written in Java. Old Mathematica solutions can be found [here](https://github.com/dpark3542/ProjectEuler/tree/d68aa8487fd90615790529b85858c09c9f7de538/src/solutions/mathematica).

I aim to provide an outline of the solution in the comments. Not every solution has an explanation. Some problems are skipped, but the gaps will be filled in eventually.
