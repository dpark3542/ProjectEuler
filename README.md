# ProjectEuler

This is a collection of solutions to the problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).
Problems are not being solved in order.

Every solved problem has a Java 8 solution.

The Java solutions are general and meant to be easy to replicate in other languages.
The Java solutions contain brief solution outlines in the comments.

Some solutions are in Mathematica 11.1.

The Mathematica solutions will often use library functions not available in other languages and primarily focus on short and compact code.
The Mathematica solutions will not have solution outlines.
Not all problems have Mathematica solutions.
