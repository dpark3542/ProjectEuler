# ProjectEuler

This is a collection of my solutions to the problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

Solutions are written in Java. A brief explanation of each solution can be found in the comments. Old Mathematica solutions can be found [here](https://github.com/dpark3542/ProjectEuler/tree/d68aa8487fd90615790529b85858c09c9f7de538/src/solutions/mathematica).

Originally, problems were solved in order. They are now solved by difficulty.

Problems 73 through 125 have been solved and will eventually be written up. A later goal of mine will be to write the explanations in LaTeX.
