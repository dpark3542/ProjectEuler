# ProjectEuler

This is a collection of my solutions to the problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

Solutions are written in Java. A brief explanation of each solution can be found in the comments.

Old Mathematica solutions can be found [here](https://github.com/dpark3542/ProjectEuler/tree/d68aa8487fd90615790529b85858c09c9f7de538/src/solutions/mathematica).

All problems up to 151 have been solved and will be written up.
