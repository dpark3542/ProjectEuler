# ProjectEuler

This is a collection of my solutions to the problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

All solutions are in Java 8 or Mathematica 11.1. The Java solutions are general and meant to be easy to replicate in other languages. The Mathematica solutions will often use library functions not available in other languages and primarily focus on clean and compact code. The Java solutions contain brief solution outlines in the comments. The Mathematica solutions will not have solution outlines.
